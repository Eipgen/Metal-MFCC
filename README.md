# Metal-MFCC

## Description 

Metal molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (Metal-MFCC) approach is developed for efficient linear-scaling quantum calculation of potential energy and atomic forces of metalloprotein. In this approach, the potential energy of a given protein is calculated by a linear combination of potential energies of the neighboring residues, two-body interaction energy between non-neighboring residues that are spatially in close contact and the potential energy of the metal binding group. The calculation of each fragment is embedded in a field of point charges representing the remaining protein environment.
